        <ui>My name is Shihab Delwar and I am a sophomore at Binghamton University majoring in Computer Science. </li>

        <br>
        <ui>I’m passionate about leveraging the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to make technology more accessible for everyone, especially for individuals who find it challenging to navigate digital tools. Many people, particularly those with limited exposure to technology, often face barriers when interacting with modern devices and software. I want to bridge this gap by developing intuitive, user-friendly solutions that require minimal technical knowledge to operate.</ui>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ui>My goal is to design intelligent systems that adapt to users' needs, simplifying their interaction with technology. Whether it's through personalized interfaces or AI-driven assistants that guide users step by step, I believe we can make technology more inclusive and less intimidating for everyone. I’m excited to apply my skills in AI to real-world problems and create solutions that empower individuals, regardless of their technical background.</ui>
